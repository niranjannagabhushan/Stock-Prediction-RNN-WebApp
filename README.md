## Stock Prediction using Simple RNN WebApp


- A simple projects to understand the price vs time relation found in the Stock Data available through Yahoo Finance

- To capture the complex pattern in our data i have used a simple RNN LSTM network

- Note: i have used tanh activation function instaed of relu because Tensorflow does not run RNN with relu activation

- Model is trained on Tata Motors Stock data but it can be changed

- More Complex model will be implemented later on
